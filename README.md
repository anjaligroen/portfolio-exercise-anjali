# Winc Academy: Portfolio Exercise

This is a simple portfolio website created using React as part of a Winc Academy assignment. The goal of the project was to practice structuring a personal website with reusable components and styling using CSS.

## Learning goals

- Structure a single-page application with React
- Create and reuse functional components
- Organize a portfolio layout using sections (About, Projects, Contact)
- Style components with plain CSS
- Practice clean file organization and JSX syntax

## Technologies used

- React (JavaScript)
- JSX
- CSS3
- Vite (for local development)

## What I built

- A responsive, component-based portfolio webpage
- Sections for About Me, Projects, and Contact
- A clean and organized layout using semantic HTML structure within React
- Internal navigation through component structure

## Result

A simple but effective portfolio webpage built with React, serving as a foundation for future improvements and expansion.
